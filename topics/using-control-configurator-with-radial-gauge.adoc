The Radial Gauge Control Configurator is a visual tool that enables the developer to very quickly visually configure an Infragistics Xamarin.Forms {RadialGaugeName} control with a real-time preview of the control as it is being configured. The Preview is close to how it will appear at runtime on the mobile device.
