[[Introduction]]
== Introduction
 
Control Configurators are visual tools the enable the developer to very quickly visually configure an Infragistics Xamarin.Forms control with a real-time preview of the control as it is being configured. The preview is close to how it will appear at runtime on the mobile device.

[[WhyUse]]
== Why Use a Control Configurator?

Control Configurators enable the developer to:

- Quickly configure the target control using a Quick Set (applies to gauges).
- Visually  configure a control using gallery items with preview images.
- Learn and master the feature rich Infragistics Xamarin.Forms controls using the property grid that is categorized by feature, making it very easy to focus on one aspect of the control at a time.

After using the Control Configurators for a short time, you’ll be an expert in configuring the rich Infragistics Xamarin.Forms controls.

[[KnownIssues]]

[[Features]]
== Features

The features are common to all Control Configurators.

- Quick Sets (gauges only) enable instantly configuring a control by selecting a pre-configured control from the Quick Sets Ribbon Gallery.
- Brushes and Outlines enable selecting a set of brushes or outlines. The number of colors in a set of brushes or outlines are dynamically determined by the target they will be applied to. If 4 are required 4 will be displayed, if 7, 7 will be displayed. 
- Control Configurators enable developers to configure a control using the same background color that it will be rendered on at runtime.
- Brushes and Outlines in the Gallery can be rendered using the configurator background color if desired.  This makes it real easy to see how a set of brushes will look on a background color.
- A control bounding box outline is provided to show the developer the control’s size relative to the area provided by the parent layout control.
- The Data Binding Builder is a visual tool for creating data bindings.
- Design-Time Data allows the developer to set values and see the control respond to those values.
- The Resource Selector allows assigning a resource defined in App.xaml or the local page to a property on the control.
- Rich property grid for setting, inspecting, data binding, setting resources, or resetting property values.
- Ribbon button has links to Xamarin.Forms controls and configurator help documents.
