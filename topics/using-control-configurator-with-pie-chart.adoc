[[Introduction]]
== Introduction  

The Pie Chart Control Configurator is a visual tool that enables the developer to very quickly visually configure an Infragistics Xamarin.Forms {PieChartName} control with a real-time preview of the control as it is being configured. The Preview is close to how it will appear at runtime on the mobile device.

Real-time sample data is created after data binding the ItemsSource is made; this sample data inflates the Pie Chart on the configurator layout surface using the types in your project.
